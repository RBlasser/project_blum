### ⚠️ **PRICE ANALYSIS: $0.0684/stem is LOWER THAN CURRENT MARKET**

**Confidence Level: MEDIUM-HIGH (75%)**

**Key Finding:**

1. ✅ Panama data spans 2020-2025 (5-year average)

4. ✅ May include shorter stems (30-40cm) and lower quality grades
5. ✅ Bulk contract pricing vs spot market pricing

**Final Assessment:**
The price of **$0.0684 per rose stem** is **historically accurate for 2020-2025 average** but is **significantly lower than current November 2025 wholesale prices** ($0.16-$0.60/stem). This suggests:

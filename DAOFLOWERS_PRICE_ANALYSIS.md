## ✅ PANAMA PRICE VALIDATION

### **Panama Data: $0.0684/stem**

### Analysis:

**Panama's price is SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER than current wholesale prices**

**Possible Explanations:**

1. **Shorter Stems Dominate**
   - If Panama imports mostly 40cm stems: $0.16-$0.27 range
   - Budget varieties could be $0.10-$0.15
   - **Still lower than DaoFlowers minimum**

2. **Different Quality Grade**
   - DaoFlowers = Premium export quality
   - Panama may import "second grade" or "local market" quality
   - Lower grades: 30-50% discount possible

3. **Time Period Difference**
   - DaoFlowers: November 2025 (current)
   - Panama data: 2020-2025 average
   - Prices may have increased 50-100% over 5 years

4. **Different Cost Basis**
   - DaoFlowers: FOB (excludes airfreight)
   - Panama: May include different cost structure
   - Possible bulk/contract pricing

5. **Data Calculation Method**
   - Panama $0.0684 may be weighted average including:
     - Very short stems (30-40cm)
     - Off-season pricing
     - Bulk contract rates
     - Mixed quality grades

## 💡 CONCLUSION

### **Panama's $0.0684/stem is LOWER than expected**

**Most Likely Explanation:**
Panama's price represents a **multi-year average (2020-2025)** that includes:
- Inflation-adjusted lower historical prices (2020-2022)
- Mix of very short stems (30-40cm)
- Possible second-grade or local market quality
- Off-peak season pricing
- Bulk contract rates

**Current Market Reality (Nov 2025):**
- Minimum wholesale: $0.16/stem (40cm, Kenya)
- Typical range: $0.20-$0.60/stem
- Premium stems: $0.60-$1.75/stem

**Recommendation:**
The Panama data likely reflects **historical average pricing** from 2020-2025. Current 2025 wholesale prices are **2-3x higher** than the Panama average, suggesting significant price inflation in the flower market over the past 5 years.
